# hack 001

This repository contains code samples and demos from Coding Club's guided
hackathon, held on 09 August 2019. The hackathon was based around web
technologies; in particular we tried to reverse engineer web APIs and
implement our own interface for it.

The code samples rely on the Python modules
[Requests](https://3.python-requests.org/) and 
[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
Python 3 is preferred over Python 2 (duh).

#### Details about the code
* `nasa.py`: downloads the Astronomy Picture of the Day by NASA
* `xkcd.py`: downloads the latest comic on https://xkcd.com

#### Books and Resources for Learning Things
* For basic Python (and programming, in general)
  [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is extremely
  good.
* For a little advanced Python, look at
  [Think Stats](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) or 
  [Think Complexity](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/) based
  on your interests.
* [An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) 
  on MDN web docs.
* [Introduction to web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)
  on MDN web docs
* [Requests's quick start guide](https://3.python-requests.org/user/quickstart/)
* [Beautiful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
